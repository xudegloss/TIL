            There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice
            had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she
            walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
            Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;
            there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought
            was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either
            the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would
            not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
            curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about
            fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her
            great delight it fitted!
